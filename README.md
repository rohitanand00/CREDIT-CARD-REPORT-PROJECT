# Power BI Credit Card Transactions Analysis Project

This repository contains the detailed steps and analysis of a Power BI project focused on credit card transaction data and customer demographics. The project leverages MySQL for data management and Power BI for data analysis and visualization, providing valuable insights into various trends, performance metrics, and key business drivers.

### Project Overview:
The primary goal of this project was to analyze and visualize credit card transaction data using Power BI, focusing on key metrics such as revenue trends, customer demographics, and spending behaviors.
### Key Steps Taken in the Project:
1. **SQL Database Creation**:
   A SQL database was created in MySQL to store the data efficiently.
   
2. **Table Creation**:
   Relevant tables were created within the MySQL database to organize the data for analysis.

3. **Data Import**:
   Data was imported into the database from various sources, ensuring the completeness and accuracy of the dataset.

4. **Power BI Integration**:
   Data was imported directly from the MySQL database into Power BI for visualization and analysis, utilizing Power BI's robust features to create interactive dashboards and insightful reports.

### Key Insights from the Analysis:
- **Quarterly Revenue & Transaction Cost**:  
  Revenue remained steady at $14M per quarter, with transaction counts peaking at 173K in Q4, indicating a growth trend in transaction volume.

- **Revenue by Card Type**:  
  The Blue Card emerged as the most popular card, generating $47M in revenue, highlighting its widespread usage among customers.

- **Revenue by Customer Demographics**:  
  Graduates and businessmen were identified as the top spenders, contributing $23M and $18M, respectively. This insight underscores the influence of education and occupation on consumer spending habits.

- **Top Expenditure Categories**:  
  Spending on bills and entertainment led the way, with $14M and $10M spent in these categories, revealing where customers are allocating their funds.

- **Transaction Methods**:  
  Swipe transactions were the most common method, accounting for $36M in revenue, with significant contributions from chip and online transactions as well.
